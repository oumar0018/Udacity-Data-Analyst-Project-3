    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I will try Applying the concepts I learned from the lessons in Data Wrangling, to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be gathered from 3 sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- WeRateDogs Twitter archive twitter_archive_enhanced.csv which is given. it contains tweet data about dog rating, name, and \"stage\"\n",
    "- tweet image predictions image-predictions.tsv which is also available for download (the link is given). This file contains dog breed prediction results for all images from the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.\n",
    "- Twitter API tweepy: Idially I should use this API to query additional data (in JSON format) for each tweet ID in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. But at the time I am writing this, my twitter developer account is not ready, so, I will use Udacity provided equivalent data set tweet_json.txt for completing the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "After gathering the data, I will assess it visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues. figure out at least eight (8) quality issues and two (2) tidiness issues.\n",
    "I will clean each of the issues identified, document the cleaning steps taken and store the results to a clean and tidy DataFrame.\n",
    "I will also Analyze and visualize the wrangled data to produce at least three (3) insights and one (1) visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a 300-600 word written report with brief description of the wrangling efforts, frame it as an internal document. Create another 250-word-minimum written report to communicate the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from the wrangled data. Frame it as an external document, like a blog post or magazine articleimport pandas as pd \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "gathering the data include:\n",
    "- Importing the twitter achive file and reading as csv\n",
    "- Downloading image prediction file from the given url\n",
    "- reading the downloaded file as jason"
